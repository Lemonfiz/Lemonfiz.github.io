            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Hello I am becoming a web developer.  I really like being able to
            learn code and be able to creat something using these new languages
            although when I run into a syntax error, or something doesn't look
            exactly right on my web page it drives me nuts.  I am gonna try to
            embed a gif into this post.... I failed.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">What the fuck is an ATS?</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I moved to San Diego with the hopes of becoming a great hiring consultant that could
bring human resources into the new century.  Upon arrival my hopes of finding a secure
job quickly were dashed, and I also found that the industry needed more help than I
realized.</p>
<p>Every Interview I attended had one thing in common.  They wanted to know my
experience with applicant tracking systems <em>(ATS)</em>, Vendor management systems <em>(VMS)</em>,
<em>CRM’s</em>, etc.  The only <em>ATS</em> I had ever worked on was a small CSU hosted one when I
worked as a recruitment assistant doing some hiring.  I never learned about any of these
systems in any classes or books or talking to professors, yet these companies held up
ATS as the grand solution to hiring.  </p>
<p>Now that I have looked at some ATS I will admit they are helpful, and they all
essentially serve the same purpose to track applicants, which previously was done with
paper and tables.  ATS fluency is treated as complicated as language fluency yet I can’t
major in ADP workforce or BambooHR.</p>
